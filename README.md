# react-native-facebook-ui
Pure javascript prototype of iOS Facebook UI for React Native framework. This only includes the newsfeed page--more to be updated in the future!
This application may not run correctly on Android. Feel free to submit a pull reqeust for the fixed styling for Android version.

##Inspiration
I was inspired by an app I use everyday--Facebook! :-)
